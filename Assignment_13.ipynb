        "As for the repercussions of using both positive and negative indexing, it mostly depends on the context and the specific use case. Some potential considerations include:\n",

        "Code readability: Mixing positive and negative indices might make the code harder to read and understand, especially for other developers who may work on the code later.\n",

        "Potential for off-by-one errors: When using both positive and negative indices, it's important to be careful with the boundaries to avoid off-by-one errors. The programmer needs to ensure that the indices are used correctly to avoid accessing elements beyond the valid range.\n",

        "In Python, when an exception is raised, the interpreter looks for an appropriate exception handler to handle the exception. The process of matching the raised exception to the appropriate exception handler follows a specific order, known as exception handling hierarchy. Here's how class-based exceptions are matched to handlers:\n",
        "\n",
        "The interpreter looks for an exception handler within the currently executing function. This handler can handle the specific exception class raised or any of its superclasses. If a matching handler is found, it is executed, and the flow of control continues from there.\n",
        "\n",
        "If no matching handler is found within the current function, the interpreter moves up the call stack, searching for an exception handler in the calling function. This process continues up the call stack until a matching handler is found or until the exception propagates to the top level of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the exception propagates to the top level of the program without finding a matching handler, the interpreter will typically terminate the program and display a traceback, which includes information about the exception and the stack trace leading up to it."

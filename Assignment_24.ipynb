        "\n",
        "In most programming languages, including Python, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module. However, when multiple import statements are used for the same module, only the first import statement actually performs the module import. Subsequent import statements are effectively ignored because the module has already been imported into memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary goal of importing the same module multiple times would typically be to provide alias names or to access different components of the module in a more convenient way. For example, consider a situation where you have a module named math_operations that contains various mathematical functions. You could use multiple import statements with different aliases to access specific functions more directly:\n",
        "\n",
        "from math_operations import add, subtract\n",
        "from math_operations import multiply as mult\n",
        "In this case, the add and subtract functions are imported directly, while the multiply function is imported with the alias mult. This allows you to use the functions as add(2, 3), subtract(5, 1), and mult(4, 2).\n",
        "\n",
        "Another situation where multiple import statements may be beneficial is when you want to organize your code by grouping related functions together. By importing the same module multiple times and selecting specific components, you can create cleaner and more modular code.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's important to note that excessive use of multiple import statements for the same module can lead to code confusion and make it harder to understand the dependencies in your code. It's generally recommended to use import statements judiciously and keep them organized to enhance code readability and maintainability."

        "One characteristic of a module is that it is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates a specific functionality or a set of related functions, classes, or variables. Modules in programming languages like Python allow for modular programming, which promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",

        "Additionally, modules can have their own namespace, which means they define their own scope for variables, functions, and classes. This allows you to avoid naming conflicts with other modules or the main program.\n",
        "In Python, modules are typically stored in separate files, with each file representing a module. The module file can be imported and used in other parts of the program to access its contents. Modules can be part of the standard library that comes with the language or created by developers to extend the language's capabilities or provide specific functionalities for their projects.\n",

        "\n",
        "To avoid mutual or circular importing in a program, you can follow some best practices and apply design patterns. Here are a few approaches you can take:\n",
        "\n",
        "Restructure the code: Analyze the interdependencies between modules and consider restructuring your code to eliminate the circular dependencies. This could involve moving common functionality to a separate module that both modules can import, or refactoring code to break dependencies between modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dependency inversion: Apply the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) from the SOLID principles. Instead of directly importing concrete classes or modules, introduce an abstraction or interface that both modules depend on. This way, the modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, reducing the likelihood of circular dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Import where needed: Import modules only where they are needed, preferably at the function or method level, rather than at the top of the file. This helps avoid importing modules unnecessarily and reduces the chances of circular dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use local imports: Instead of importing modules at the top-level of your module, consider importing them locally within the functions or methods where they are required. This approach allows for more control over the import order and can help avoid circular importing issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Refactor common functionality: If two modules are importing each other because they share common functionality, consider refactoring that functionality into a separate module or class that can be imported by both modules without creating circular dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use runtime imports: In some cases, you may need to delay the import until runtime to break the circular dependency. Instead of importing modules at the top-level, import them within functions or methods when they are needed. This approach can help resolve circular import issues by ensuring that modules are imported only when required.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analyze and test: Regularly analyze your codebase for circular dependencies using tools or static analysis. Perform thorough testing to ensure that the program works correctly and does not encounter any hidden bugs due to circular importing."

By keeping track of the current line being executed, you can easily implement features such as stepping through the script line by line, setting breakpoints, or jumping to specific lines for debugging or analysis purposes. This level of control enhances the developer's ability to understand and debug the RPN script.\n",

This capability enables the execution of conditional statements and control flow within the RPN script, expanding its expressive power.\n",

With the ability to track the current line being executed, you can implement features that allow users to modify the script dynamically, insert or remove lines, or interact with the RPN interpreter at specific points. This interactivity can be useful for interactive debugging, experimentation, or live script modification scenarios."

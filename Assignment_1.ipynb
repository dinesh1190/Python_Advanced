OOP promotes code reusability, modularity, and abstraction through concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. It provides a structured and efficient approach to solving complex problems and improving code organization and maintainability."

        "In Python, the first argument in a class's method function is conventionally named self, although you can use any valid variable name. This first argument is special because it refers to the instance of the class on which the method is called. It allows the method to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and perform operations specific to that instance.\n",

        "The self parameter acts as a reference to the instance itself and enables you to access instance variables and other methods within the class. When a method is called on an instance, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to the method, which is why you need to include self as the first parameter in the method definition.\n",

        "\n",
        "The __getattr__ and __getattribute__ methods are both special methods in Python that are used for attribute access. However, they have some important differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "__getattr__(self, name): This method is called when an attribute is accessed and not found through the usual process of attribute lookup. It takes the name of the attribute as a parameter and should return the value of the attribute or raise an AttributeError if the attribute is not found. __getattr__ is only called if the attribute is not found through normal lookup, meaning it won't be called for attributes that actually exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "__getattribute__(self, name): This method is called for every attribute access, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not. It is invoked before checking if the attribute is present in the object's dictionary or in the class hierarchy. __getattribute__ allows you to customize the behavior of attribute access for all attributes, including existing ones. However, you need to be cautious when using __getattribute__ because accessing attributes within the method itself can lead to infinite recursion if not handled properly."

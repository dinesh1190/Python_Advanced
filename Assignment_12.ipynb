        "\n",
        "Indexing refers to the process of accessing individual elements within a sequence or collection.\n",

        "The index is an integer that represents the position of an element within the sequence.\n",

        "Slicing is a technique used to extract a subsequence or a portion of a sequence.\n",
        "It allows you to retrieve multiple elements from a sequence by specifying a range or slice of indices.\n",
        "A slice is defined by two indices separated by a colon (:) inside square brackets.\n",
        "The first index is the starting point of the slice (inclusive), and the second index is the endpoint (exclusive).\n",

        "Slicing can be seen as a more versatile and powerful version of indexing, allowing you to extract subsequences of various lengths.\n",
        "Both indexing and slicing operate on sequences, such as strings, lists, or arrays, and are commonly used in programming to manipulate and retrieve data efficiently."

It allows you to write code that might raise an exception and provides a way to handle those exceptions gracefully, without causing the program to crash or terminate unexpectedly.\n",

        "The exception handler is defined in one or more except blocks that follow the try block.\n",
        "The except block that matches the type of the raised exception is executed, and any necessary actions can be taken within the except block to handle the exception.\n",
        "After executing the except block, the program continues with the code that follows the try-except statement.\n",
        "By using try-except statements, you can anticipate and handle exceptions, making your code more robust and preventing it from crashing when unexpected errors occur."

You can specify one or more except blocks after the try block, each handling a different type of exception. If an exception of the specified type occurs, the corresponding except block is executed. You can also use a generic except block without specifying any exception type to catch any unexpected exceptions that may occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "try-finally: This variation ensures that a particular block of code defined in the finally block is executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. The code within the finally block is executed after the try block finishes, regardless of whether an exception was raised or handled. This is useful for performing cleanup actions or releasing resources that need to be done regardless of the outcome"

        "When you encounter an exceptional situation that requires your code to handle it in a specific way, you can use the raise statement to raise an appropriate exception. This can be useful when you want to indicate an error condition, signal that a certain condition has not been met, or provide custom error messages.\n",

        "The with/as statement is similar to the try/finally statement, as both are used for resource management. However, the with/as statement provides a more concise and readable syntax for managing resources. It automatically calls the __exit__() method of the context manager, even if an exception occurs within the block. This ensures that the resources are properly cleaned up, making the code more robust and less prone to resource leaks."

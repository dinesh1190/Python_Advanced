A class can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions), which define the data and actions associated with the objects created from that class. Objects created from a class are instances of that class.\n",

        "The relationship between classes and modules is that classes can be defined within modules. In many programming languages, including Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, modules act as containers or namespaces for classes. By placing related classes within a module, you can organize your code and avoid naming conflicts. This allows you to group classes with similar functionality or purpose together."

        "\n",
        "Domain Relevance: Operator overloading is particularly useful when working with domain-specific types. For example, in a mathematical library, overloading operators such as +, -, *, and / for custom numeric types can provide a more natural and convenient way of performing calculations.\n",

        "Developer Expectations: Consider the expectations of other developers who will use your code. If the overloaded operators align with common conventions and expectations within the programming language or framework, it can make your class more intuitive to use."

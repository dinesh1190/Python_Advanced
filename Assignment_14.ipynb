This is because the addition and assignment operation can be combined into a single operation, eliminating the need for an additional assignment statement.\n",

The wrapper function or class provides additional functionality, such as modifying the behavior of the wrapped function or adding extra functionality before or after its execution. The primary purpose of a wrapper is to extend or modify the behavior of the wrapped feature without directly modifying it.\n",

It is the core functionality that is being augmented or modified by the wrapper. The wrapped feature can be any callable object, including functions, methods, or even classes.\n",

In Python, decorators are represented by the @decorator_function or @decorator_class syntax, which is applied directly above the function or method definition. Decorators provide a concise and elegant way to modify the behavior of functions or methods without explicitly calling or modifying them.\n",

        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: Generators produce values one at a time, only when requested. Unlike functions that return entire sequences or lists, generators generate values on-the-fly, saving memory by not requiring the storage of the entire sequence in memory at once. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences, as it allows you to work with data without the need for excessive memory allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators employ a concept known as lazy evaluation or lazy execution. The values are generated and returned as requested, which means that computations are deferred until necessary. This can be advantageous when dealing with computationally expensive operations or when working with sequences where not all values may be needed. Lazy evaluation allows for efficient utilization of resources by only performing calculations when required.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterative Processing: Generators are natural iterators and can be easily integrated into iterative processing workflows. They can be used directly in for loops or combined with other iterator functions like map(), filter(), or reduce(). Generators facilitate a more efficient and elegant way of processing data iteratively, providing a clean and readable code structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Infinite Sequences: Generators offer a practical way to work with infinite sequences. Since generators generate values on-demand, you can create infinite sequences that can be consumed without worrying about running out of memory or reaching a predefined limit. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to work with continuous data streams, numerical series, or generators that generate values dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stateful Iteration: Generators can maintain internal state, allowing them to remember their position or state between successive calls. This feature enables generators to resume where they left off and generate values based on the stored state. Stateful iteration can be leveraged to implement complex algorithms or manage iterative processes that require maintaining context or history."

        "The float and Decimal classes are both used for representing and performing arithmetic operations on numbers with decimal points in programming languages like Python. However, there are some key differences between them in terms of benefits and drawbacks.\n",

        "Benefits of float:\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficiency: Floating-point operations are usually faster than decimal operations because they are implemented directly in hardware and optimized for speed.\n",

        "Wide range: The float class typically provides a larger range of representable numbers compared to Decimal. They can handle very large and very small values, including scientific notation, which is useful for scientific and engineering calculations.\n",

        "Drawbacks of float:\n",
        "\n",
        "Precision loss: Floating-point numbers have limited precision due to their binary representation. Some decimal values cannot be represented exactly, leading to rounding errors and loss of precision in calculations.\n",

        "Inexact comparisons: Due to precision issues, comparing floating-point numbers for equality can be problematic. It is common to encounter unexpected results when comparing floating-point values.\n",

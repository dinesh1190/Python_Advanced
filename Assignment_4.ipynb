        "__iter__ method: This method enables an object to be iterable by defining the behavior of the iterator when the iter() function is called on the object. It should return an iterator object, which is an object that implements the __next__() method. The __next__() method defines the iteration logic, returning the next element in the sequence. When there are no more elements to iterate over, it should raise the StopIteration exception."

        "\n",
        "Customizing behavior: Operator overloading allows you to customize the behavior of operators on your objects. By defining the appropriate dunder methods (e.g., __add__, __sub__, __mul__, etc.), you can specify how your objects should respond to various operations. This can be useful when working with mathematical operations, comparisons, or any other operations that make sense in the context of your class.\n",

By defining intuitive operator behavior, you can write code that closely resembles the problem domain or the mathematical concepts you are working with. This can make your code more expressive and easier to understand.\n",

        "Interoperability with built-in types: Operator overloading allows your custom objects to seamlessly interact with built-in types. For example, you can add two custom objects together, concatenate them like strings, or compare them with built-in comparison operators."
